[#jwtbuilder]
=== Scheduled payloads with JWT Builder

New in Open Liberty 21.0.0.1, the `jwtBuilder` element has been enhanced with a new attribute called `nbfOffset` which can be used to configure an NBF claim for a JWT payload. The time set for the `nbfOffset` will be added to the current time and the result will determine when Json Web Tokens will start to be accepted for processing.

To configure the "not-before" claim using `jwtBuilder`, add the following to your `sever.xml` configuration file.

`<jwtBuilder nbfOffset="1800s" />`

If the JWT was issued at the current time, then the token can only be used after 1800 seconds have passed from the current time.

`jwtBuilder` is a part of the `jwt-1.0` feature, to add the feature to your project add the following to the `server.xml`:

[source, xml]
----
<server>
  <featureManager>
    <feature>jwt-1.0</feature>
  </featureManager>
</server>
----

[#redirects]
== Relative linking for HTTP Redirects

Included in Open Liberty 21.0.0.1 is an enhancement for the `servlet-4.0` feature, within Open Liberty the `sendRedirect()` is used to direct a client to a new page or location away from the original page. Previously, Open Liberty would always convert the provided relative URL in the `sendRedirect()` function to an absolute URL. This could lead to problems for applications that took advantage of reverse proxy servers.

To solve the problems presented, Open Liberty 21.0.0.1 ahs introduced a new `redirecttorelativeurl` web container property that will tell the application whether or not to construct absoulte URLs from relative redirect links. This property can be set in the `server.xml` file:

[source, xml]
----
<server>
  ...
    <webContainer redirecttorelativeurl="true"/>
  ...
</server>
----

[#conf]
=== MicroProfile Config 2.0 enters general availability

link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config] enables application configuration from different locations (ConfigSources). MicroProfile Config 2.0 in Open Liberty consumes link:https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-config[SmallRye's implementation] of the specification.

MicroProfile Config 2.0 is a major version release (from 1.4) which introduces Functional and API/SPI changes in Microprofile Config 2.0.

For a more in-depth look at the new capabilities offered by MicroProfile 2.0, take a look at the full explanation in the 20.0.0.12-beta blog post, link:https://openliberty.io/blog/2020/10/27/microprofile40-jakartaee9-beta-200012.html#conf[here].


To enable MicroProfile Config 2.0 in your app, add the following to your `server.xml`:

[source, xml]
----
<featureManager>
   <feature>mpConfig-2.0</feature>
</featureManager>
----

[#bugs]
== Notable bugs fixed in this release

We’ve spent some time fixing link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues?q=label%3Arelease%3A200011+label%3A%22release+bug%22[bugs in 21.0.0.1], including the following issues:

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/14936[Improved recovery when core components are reinstalled at runtime]
+
Previously, Open Liberty contained a flaw in the detection of changes to the JARs that compose the server implementation. When such changes were detected Liberty would force the JAR to be uninstalled and installed again. In most cases this allowed the runtime to recover and function properly. In specific cases, where some core component was re-installed, Liberty would not properly recover and it would result in some Java packages to be unavailable for class loading.  For example, on Java 11 the package `javax.xml.soap` would become unavailable to the application class loaders. 
+
The most common environment where this occurred was running Open Liberty in OpenShift. This behavior has now been corrected for Open Liberty 21.0.0.1.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/14936[Enable MyFaces 2.3.7 for Open Liberty]
+
The `jsf-2.3` feature in Open Liberty makes use of link:https://myfaces.apache.org/core23/index.html[Apache MyFaces] JavaServer Faces implementation. With the release of Apache MyFaces 2.3.7 a number of improvements and bug fixes have been made, for more information visit the link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10600&version=12346524[Apache MyFaces 2.3.7 changelog].

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/15337[Dynacache initialization issue when ID is missing]
+
An external user discovered that the initialization of a `distributedMap` fails with a NullPointerException if the `id` element is not present in the `distributedMap` configuration.
A clearer message should have been displayed to indicate the required `id` element is missing.  To address this the `distributedMap` definition has been modified to mark the `id` element as required.
+
The configuration runtime will now issue an error message: 
+
`CWWKG0058E: The element distributedMap with the unique identifier default-0 is missing the required attribute id.`
+
and the `distributedMap` will not be put into service. This new behaviour is introduced in Open Liberty 21.0.0.1. 

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/14925[OAuth user registry lookups may use incorrect custom cache key]
+
In previous releases, a flaw existed where a previously authenticated user’s `Subject` might not be found in the authentication cache during an OAuth authentication flow, when using a custom user registry. The cache key used to retrieve user claims from the authentication cache was based on the realm and username, but the correct cache key might be a combination of the OAuth provider name and the OAuth token object itself. The behavior has been corrected and the appropriate cache key should now be used.
+
For more information visit the link:https://openliberty.io/docs/20.0.0.12/reference/feature/oauth-2.0.html[Open Liberty Documentation].

* Add HTTP/2 IOException for misbehaving client error case
+
It was previously possible for the HTTP/2 channel to throw a `NullPointerException` when it attempted to write out HTTP headers on a connection that had been terminated due to a connection error. Beginning in Open Liberty 21.0.0.1, the HTTP/2 channel will now throw a more informative `IOException` for this scenario. Read more about link:https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/cwlp_servlet40_http2.html[Open Liberty's support for HTTP/2].

* CONTAINER_NAME env variable is not reflected in logstashCollector-1.0
+
Starting from Open Liberty 20.0.0.9, JSON logs created by the `logstashCollector-1.0` feature do not properly reflect the value set for the environment variable `CONTAINER_NAME`. The value set for `CONTAINER_NAME` should be reflected in the `serverName` field of the JSON logs, but the default server name from `wlp.server.name` is shown instead. This behaviour has been corrected for Open Liberty 21.0.0.1, visit the link:https://openliberty.io/docs/20.0.0.12/forwarding-logs-logstash.html[Logstash Collector Documentation] for more information.
