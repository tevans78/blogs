The new Open Liberty Tools IntelliJ extension provides you with an easier way to view and interact with your Open Liberty projects in IntelliJ.  

You can start Open Liberty in development (dev) mode, make changes to your application while the server is running, debug your application, and run tests and view the corresponding test reports all through the Liberty Dev Dashboard.

In prior blogs, we have shown you how Open Liberty dev mode can be https://openliberty.io/blog/2019/10/22/liberty-dev-mode.html[run from a command line with Maven] and with https://openliberty.io/blog/2020/03/11/gradle-dev-mode-open-liberty.html[Gradle].  In this blog post, you will see how the Open Liberty Tools extension improves the developer experience by conveniently displaying Open Liberty projects and dev mode interactions within IntelliJ.  

Check out a demo of Open Liberty Toosl for IntelliJ:

== Installing the extension

Install the Open Liberty Tools extension from the IntelliJ Plugins Marketplace.

== Setting up the project

For Maven projects, dev mode requires the Liberty Maven Plugin. Specify the Liberty maven Plugin with version `3.1` or higher in your project’s `pom.xml` file.
[source,xml]
----
    <plugin>
        <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
        <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>3.1</version>
    </plugin>
----

For Gradle projects, dev mode requires the Liberty Gradle Plugin. Specify the Liberty Gradle Plugin with version `3.0` or higher in your project’s `build.gradle` file.
[source,groovy]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'io.openliberty.tools:liberty-gradle-plugin:3.0'
    }
}
----

== Interacting with dev mode

Once the Liberty Maven Plugin is specified in your `pom.xml` file, or the Liberty Gradle Plugin is specified in your `build.gradle` file, your project name will be listed under the Liberty Dev Dashboard.  You can interact with dev mode by right-clicking on your project name, or selecting a command from the drop-down below the project name.  Alternatively, you can use the “Execute Liberty Dev Task” option in the dashboard toolbar.

== Commands

The following commands can be run via the Liberty Dev Dashboard:

|=========================================================
|Command | Description
| Run tests | Runs the unit tests and integration tests that are configured for your project. This command requires dev mode to be already started.
| Start | Starts dev mode.
| Start... | Starts dev mode with custom parameters.  For example, to run tests automatically after every change, include the `-DhotTests` parameter.  Additional supported parameters can be found in the documentation for the https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven/blob/master/docs/dev.md#additional-parameters[dev goal of the Liberty Maven Plugin] and https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.gradle/blob/master/docs/libertyDev.md#command-line-parameters[libertyDev task of the Liberty Gradle Plugin].
| Stop | Stops dev mode.
| View integration test report | Views the integration test report file.
| View unit test report | Views the unit test report file.
